# Algorithms in C

I'm working on learning to code algorithms from the book by Robert Sedgewick and I am using the C programming language. Here's the stuff I'm currently playing around with. I'll try to update this as I go.

### Chapter 2: 
**Euclid's Algorithm** 
- Finding the greatest common divisor of any two numbers.
- I created a few variations of programs using Euclid's Algorithm.

### Chapter 3:
**Elementary Data Structures**
- Completed all exercises for this chapter. Linked lists are much clearer to work with than parallel arrays in my opinion. The pushdown stack with parallel arrays is something I will need to review further, but I'm looking forward to expanding this comfort with stacks and queues to the next chapter on trees.
